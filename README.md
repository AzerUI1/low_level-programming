🚀 What’s Inside?

This repository contains:

Core C language fundamentals

Memory and pointer manipulation

Working with arrays, strings, and structures

File input/output and system calls

Dynamic memory allocation (malloc, free)

Bitwise operations

Compilation, debugging, and Makefiles

Each topic is organized in its own directory with:

✅ Task explanations

✅ C source code (.c)

✅ Header files (.h) when needed

✅ A Makefile to build the project

🛠️ Requirements

To run or compile the programs, you’ll need:

GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

Linux or macOS recommended (Windows + WSL also works)

Basic terminal knowledge (cd, ls, make, etc.)

Example compile command:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic file.c -o program

📚 Learning Goals

By completing this repository, you’ll be able to:

Understand how the computer manages memory

Write efficient and clean C code

Debug using tools like gdb and valgrind

Build programs using modular design and Makefiles

Think like a real system programmer 💻
